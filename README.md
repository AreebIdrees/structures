Aim: To learn Object oriented programming in C++

Theory: Differences between structures and classes: Class:

Members of a class are private by default.
It is normally used for data abstraction
and further inheritance.
Null values are allowed in classes.
A class is a reference type.
Structures:
Members of a structure are public by default.
It is normally used for the grouping of data
Null values are not permitted in structures
A structure is a value type.
Structure is type/collection of dataset. It can have different types of data in it.The variables in a structure are public by default. Whereas variables in a class are private by default. But they can be made public as well. We can also create functions inside a class. Which can be called inside the main function. We can call the function in the main function using the " . " operator. Eg:(name_of_variable).(name_of_function), cube1.volume

Algorithm:

Start => create class => define variables inside of the class => create functions inside the class to take in put of measurements of the cube and to calculate volume of the cube and then print it =>
=> call functions in main function and get output => End

Explanation of the algorithm:

First we include the header file. Then we create a class of any name that we want. We define variables in side the class. We create functions inside the class to take input of the measurements of the cube and to calculate volume of the cube and print it. Then we xstart the main function. Then we call the functions from the class, using " . " operator, to perform their following functions. Then we get output at the end.
